Start off by cloning the Repository!

### Using a Virtual Environment, Flask, and Requests
This site uses Flask and requests, which need to be installed. Please use a virtual environent, or "venv", to do so. 

Installing a venv is not so hard! 
Type this into your terminal to create one and set it up for this program. 
In this tutorial, the venv will be called "myVenv", but you can call yours whatever you like!
  
```
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv myVenv
  ```
  
Next, activate your venv like this
```
source myVenv/bin/activate
```
  
For Mac and Linux users, activate your venv this way:
```
$ . myVenv/bin/activate
```

For Windows users, do it this way: 
```
$ . <name>/Scripts/activate
  ```
  
Once you have activated myVenv, continue by installing flask and requests:
```
$ pip install flask
$ pip install requests
```
With myVenv still activated, finish by running the application!

```
python app.py
```


Hope you enjoy!
